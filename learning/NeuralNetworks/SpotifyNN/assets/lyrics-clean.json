Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!) Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; and if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances You are just what the doc ordered  I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box  They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot  But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes  I got a laptop in my back pocket  My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs Feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad It's actually disastrously bad for the wack While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)  Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew) MC's get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run-D.M.C And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n",

Friends doin' nothin' Don't fuck with 'em Shouldn't be stuck with 'em Best of luck to them Get up, get out and get something Hook up again You always procrastinatin' That shit get me aggravated You wake up and act complacent Watch videos of girls when they ass is shakin' Don't you want a girl in real life? Don't you want a crib? You could fuck all night Don't you wanna buy yo' mom something real nice? Don't you wanna stunt? Live that life? Don't you wanna pull up in a ride that you don't even drive? Hop out the back like, \"Surprise\"! Don't you wanna rock some kicks that don't nobody have And tell a lame nigga be quiet?   I'm not saying that that's all that matters",

Not the expression No, literally give an arm for When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma Turns right around and bites you And everything you stand for turns on you despite you What happens when you become the main source of pain  \"Daddy look what I made\" Dad's gotta go catch a plane \"Daddy where's mommy?\" \"I can't find mommy, where is she?\" I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writin' a song, the song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog, then you got to swing by yourself  Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother, who's a spittin' image of her That's Slim Shady Yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye-baby, huh...  And when I'm gone, just carry on Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back  And when I'm gone, just carry on Don't mourn, rejoice everytime you hear the sound of my voice Just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back",

Got a message saying sorry for your loss I didn't know if it was real now Praying that they got wrong number Tell me how the fuck I gotta deal now I was goin thru the motions I was doin all my shit Turnin twenty in the city I was too focused to quit Got on FaceTime with my granny and she told she was proud One week later she was gone and now she up above the clouds Never got the chance to tell that I loved her for her legacy Everything she did and all she wanted was the best for me Tell me why the good times always comin with the bad Never thought I'd see the tears ever comin from my dad I been on a mission ever since Get it while I can Everyday I gotta reminisce",

Cause the same people asking why you're doing it Were asking how you did it So fuck a critic, stay committed to your vision They can't see it, it's yours The top floor looks far when you can't get in the doors But it's crazy what you can see with your eyes closed I swear I stay on my grind mode I know I'm getting closer  [Closer, closer Closer than I've ever been",

Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up? For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!

Snap back to reality Oh, there goes gravity Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no He won't have it, he knows His whole back's to these ropes It don't matter, he's dope He knows that, but he's broke He's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's... Back to the lab again, yo This whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him  You better Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it You better never let it go You only get one shot Do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo",

(let me see u) I wasn't born last night I know these hoes ain't right But you was blowing up her phone last night But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh Nigga, that's that nerve Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse? Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine? You know how the game goes She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh Nigga, that's that nerve You all about her, and she all about hers Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos And I done did everything, but trust these hoes (CB fuck with me!)  When A rich nigga want ya And your nigga can't do nothing for ya  These hoes ain't loyal These hoes ain't loyal  Yeah, yeah, let me see u Just got rich Took a broke nigga bitch  I can make a broke bitch rich But I don't fuck with broke bitches Got a white girl with some fake titties I took her to the Bay with me  Eyes closed, smoking marijuana Rolling up that Bob Marley  I'm a rasta",

One side's controlled by material things The others live for experience and everything it brings I'm the king of the latter, sing about what matters At the ball park with my friends swing batta batta Just another summers day, watch the sun fade away All I gotta say is we'll never change Get away from it all not a care in the world Watch the sun hit the water as the waves curl No plans but a drink in my hand No shoes, no shirt, swimsuit, ray bans Get away from it all no one knows where we're hiding Come on baby girl the water's fine just dive in Ain't a dream so open your eyes, we're just living in paradise",

To memorize the way you shock me The way you move it here (hey) Just wanna feel it from you (hey)  Don't be afraid to catch feels Ride drop top and chase thrills (hey) I know you ain't afraid to pop pills (hey) Baby, I know you ain't scared to catch feels Feels with me  I'm your window shopper, sucker for your love, oh I'm wearing your goggles, virtual reality It ain't what it cost you, it might be a dollar As long as it shocks you, memory, electricity",

Everything's alright, When you're right here by my side. When you look me in the eyes, I catch a glimpse of heaven. I find my paradise, When you look me in the eyes. How long will I be waiting, To be with you again",

Yo no quiero ser jabón ni ser espuma Que al final corre en la bruma Por la planta de tus pies Yo no quiero que me enjuagues por tus piernas Que me ignores y te mientas Cuando sé que mueres por volverme a ver  Yo no quiero ser jabón ni ser espuma Que al final corre en la bruma Por la planta de tus pies ",

He was on Friday Night Lights? Nah nah, he did it on The Warm Up yo When he did the Last Call on the warmup I was like: Damn I'm tryna do mine So since this joint got that vibe I'ma do my Last Call right now for y'all And my voice is messed up too, this is the last track of Young Sinatra  Yeah, yeah Back in the day I wasn't shit, homie Penny pinching I couldn't even pay the rent, homie Thinkin' 'bout it I'm wondering where the years went, homie Just a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me I was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin' homie I was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin' homie Letting them slip away, my dreams wasn't waitin' on me This for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen I'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did And yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kid But that shit came from sacrifice Not on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen) Yeah  Someway somehow, I understood finally If you want to come and get it you know where to find me Cause I don't got no time for anyone who be tryin' me Know if they don't understand I'ma leave 'em behind me I'll be asleep I ain't got no time, no no I said I'll be asleep I said I don't got no time, no, no, no  Yeah, yeah I treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA And this that southern playa-listic shit like we was in the eight Back in the day, I was young, broke and infamous A Young Sinatra, I was undeniable Who welcomed you to forever while Under Pressure And told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino And Everybody in the Ultra 85 Goddamn it feel good to be alive And all these bitches that I passed up Couldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up Member creeping with the gat, masked up  Goddamn it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man What it was like growing up. Damn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib, doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff. Meanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together, I was tryna make sense-sense of all this shit around me, I didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean. And then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit, but I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house, and just, so much going on. And I'm sure everybody was probably like, damn, yo  Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?\" On the real, I was doin' anything to run away And that's the same reason kids join gangs every day Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected Meanwhile, white america quick to call him a thug But all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love Tell him that he love him, that he need him Promise he won't ever leave him Never smoke crack, never lie, and he'll never beat him I feel like all my life I been needing a break Looking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake And I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great Oh my God please, can I have a conversation with 'em? Member of my family without they hand out asking for five G's To pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh) I learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime I'll give you something worth more, that's my time I ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge Unless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college And hit me on the phone, hit me up Like \" Uncle Bob, where you at? Yeah I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that I'm glad we family\" (uh) We a half breed family, yeah, yeah, uh  Man see I remember when I was like fifteen years old and my dad took me to the studio--I know this is random I'm",

He saw my gat and my jacket and froze I told him I ain't want no problem But he chose to reach for the shotty anyway So I blew him away Just tryna get some gas, now his brain blast, uh Frozen thinkin' about what just happened, now it's in the past Jump in the whip 0 to 60, yeah we out fast See that red and blue flash, damn the cops is on my ass Hear them sirens, flashing lights in my rear view This shit like a movie in a theater near you 120 now, I feel like OJ (The cops are gonna get us)",

They come to my fortress I apologize for all the corpses It's a mess right now But I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins We ain't talked in like six years Why you writing me now? I just turned 100k down Just to keep the brand looking right, now (that's real) I ain't bragging about the money I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account",

Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (woo!)

My ex hates to talk, she's a texter Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her Wants to get back together Said not till she gets her act together  She thinks I'm bein' mean And now she starts to scream and shout She's about to let the demons out She don't want to see me with other females out I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house in her evening gown with her cleavage out We've been down this road too many times for me to count And all I can think is how  I just want you to be normal Why can't you bitches be normal? Always gotta be so extra Like a fuckin' terrestrial Guess it comes with the territory My ex girl, she just declared war Therefore, I better prepare for it I guess bein' weird's normal  And I don't know what's got a hold of me Most notably I've been zoning to Jodeci",

You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints  Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin' At anything that may stand in they way As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay  Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee Must have missed my CAT scan that day (yeah!) I just threw a Tampax at Dre  Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray I'm turning back to a madman, can't take Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage My basal ganglia's an A to the K  Get your ass sprayed like bidets Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist You chumps don't even know how to do somethin' To give goosebumps a day when you say  That somethin' you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but  Guess that's the standard I'm held to But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya You set a mark too high when platinum sales are  Looked at as a failure (yeah) Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper 'Cause damn it I'm still the...

Full magazine could take Staples out Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin' My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view You mention me, millions of views, attention in news I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you Billions of views, your ten cents are two Skim through the music to give shit reviews To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse Don't get misconstrued, business as us' Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though Not even dissin', it just ain't for me All I am simply is just an emcee Maybe \"Stan\" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?) Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably Shake the world up if it were up to me Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill I should eat a pill, probably I will Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled) Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch Like Vice President Mike Pence Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and Jesus Christ, man, how many times is Someone gonna fuck on my bitch?

President Jefferson: I'll give him this: his financial system is a work of genius I couldn't undo it if I tried And... I've tried Who lives, who dies, who tells your story? President Madison: He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity I hate to admit it But he doesn't get enough credit for all the credit he gave us Who lives, who dies, who tells your story Every other founding father's story gets told Every other founding father gets to grow old And when you're gone, who remembers your name? Who keeps your flame? Who tells your story? Who tells your story? Who tells your story? Eliza I put myself back in the narrative",

I walk alone to the store, and it's quiet uptown. I never liked the quiet before. I take the children to church on Sunday, a sign of the cross at the door, and I pray. That never used to happen before. ANGELICA AND WOMEN If you see him in the street, walking by himself, talking to himself, have pity. HAMILTON Philip, you would like it uptown. It's quiet uptown.

HAMILTON: That's when I began to pray: Lord, show me how to say no to this. I don't know how to say no to this.

Even though we started at the very same time Alexander Hamilton began to climb. How to account for his rise to the top? Maaaaan, the man is non-stop! Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me. Are you aware that we're making hist'ry? This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation. The liberty behind deliberation– Non-stop! I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt with my assistant counsel— Co-counsel. Hamilton, sit down. Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness. That's all you had to say! Okay! One more thing– Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Soon that attitude may be your doom! Why do you write like you're running out of time? Write day and night like you're running out of time? Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time. Keep on fighting. In the meantime— Non-stop! Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony and nowhere is it stronger than in Albany. This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and Honestly that's why He's just public service seems to be calling me. Non-stop! I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it. I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it. Now for a strong central democracy If not, then I'll be Socrates Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities. Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention: I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention. There as a New York junior delegate: Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate . . . Goes and proposes his own form of government! What? His own plan for a new form of government! What? Talks for six hours! The convention is listless! Bright young man… Yo, who the eff is this? Why do you always say what you believe? Why do you always Why do you always say what you believe? say what you believe? Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies! Awww! Why do you write like it's going out of style? Going out of style hey! Write day and night like it's Going out of style? Going out of style hey! Ev'ry day you fight like it's going out of style. Do what you do. Alexander? Aaron Burr, sir.",

Rewind– Rewind– I remember that night, I just might regret that night for the rest of my days I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise I remember that dreamlike candlelight Like a dream that you can't quite place But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face I have never been the same Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame And when you said \"Hi,\" I forgot my dang name Set my heart aflame, ev'ry part aflame This is not a game \"You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.\" \"I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You forget yourself.\" \"You're like me. I'm never satisfied.\" \"Is that right?\" \"I have never been satisfied.\" \"My name is Angelica Schuyler.\" \"Alexander Hamilton.\" \"Where's your fam'ly from?\"",

Ladies and gentlemen! Here comes the general! The moment you've been waiting for!  Here comes the general! The Pride of Mount Vernon! Here comes the general! George Washington! We are out-gunned What! Out-manned What!  Out-numbered, out-planned Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom! We gotta make an all-out stand Hey yo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom! Check it — Can I be real a second? For just a millisecond? Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second? Now I'm the model of a modern major general The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all Lining up to put me up on a pedestal, writing letters to relatives  Embellishing my elegance and eloquence But the elephant is in the room The truth is in your face When you hear the British cannons go Boom! Any hope of success is fleeting How can I keep leading when the people I'm leading keep retreating?  We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn  Knight takes rook, but look We are out-gunned What! Out-manned What!  Out-numbered, out-planned! Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom We gotta make an all-out stand Hey yo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man Boom, boom, boom; boom, boom",

I'm getting nervous. Sir… I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials? You punched the bursar. Yes! I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid. So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast? It was my parents' dying wish before they passed. You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan. God, I wish there was a war!

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father Got a lot farther by working a lot harder By being a lot smarter By being a self-starter By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter  And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter  Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain  Well, the word got around, they said, \"This kid is insane, man\" Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland \"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and The world's gonna know your name. What's your name, man?\"  Alexander Hamilton My name is Alexander Hamilton And there's a million things I haven't done But just you wait, just you wait...  When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick  And Alex got better but his mother went quick  Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide",

He's trying to divide us, this shit's like a cult But like Johnny, he'll only unite us 'Cuz nothing drives us inside like this fight does Similar to when two cars collide 'cuz our spirits are crushed and this spot's a tight one But here the jaws of life come to pull us from the wreckage That's what we get pride from When we can't from our stars and stripes cuz this type of pickle we're in is hard to deal But there's always tomorrow still If we start from the scratch like a scab for scars to heal And band together for Charolettesville And for heaven's fallen heroes Fill his wall with murals Hit the damn reset, start from zero This is our renewal, spray tan get rid of Get a brand new, better, America  And here's to where we're from",

Girls your dad is a scumbag  I'm confused because  How come you can be a lord and a loser How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? A good dad, but a bad husband Why are you a good father? A great dad, but a bad husband  You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block Just a line that's hot, that I forgot We laughed a little, cried a lot I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie Day before you went to jail and daily How we would wait for that mail lady Or by the phone, for mom to call And I watch you pull yourself up And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all You're my lightning rod When my sky gets dark",

It's like I'm drowning at sea Hoping that you reach for me",

There's a missing person, so what? He's Got nothin' to do with me I'm almost certain I was framed ",

I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down Never see you Graduate in your caps and gowns It's 'bout to be 2008 How's this happening now? I've got so much more to do And proof, I'm truly sorry If I let you down, but this tore me in two The thought of no more me and you You gave me shoes, Nikes like new For me for school",

Anybody out there hearin' this? Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist And I'ma leave like that, period You sniff lines, I write lines You've now entered in my mind And you better get ready 'cause you might find I'm from a different place, and my kind It's a little bit different than yours is Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead It's just been in mournin' From the moment I quit recording Quick, record this Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough Then I'll skip the chorus I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me? Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene I don't live for the world I live for the King, I live for the King, focus",

Ain't it ironic I brought up chemistry? Cuz I was never good at math but I'm ill with the melody Since I was a kid, I had a dream that I would make it I spent thousands of hours writing music in that basement Even though I'm broke, you know why I still chase it? Cuz once you get a taste of it there is no replacement Yo, I don't rap, so millions of people will like me I rap, cuz there's millions of people just like me If you think I'm out of my mind, I ain't gonna argue, I might be But I'm not on the stage just for people to sightsee  I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste You can tell that I ain't playin' by the look up on my face The world wants to tell us who we are and who we ain't But the person that I am is somethin' you can never change Yea I'm just being me, yea I'm just being me, yea",

I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground  Matter of fact, I think I'ma' burn this room right now Some how this memory for some reason just won't burn down",

Anybody out there hearin' this? Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist And I'ma leave like that, period You sniff lines, I write lines You've now entered in my mind And you better get ready 'cause you might find I'm from a different place, and my kind It's a little bit different than yours is Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead It's just been in mournin' From the moment I quit recording Quick, record this Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough Then I'll skip the chorus I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me? Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene I don't live for the world I live for the King, I live for the King, focus",

I think I heard it before Oh yeah, I made it myself I left the door open to come in my mansion but I never said it's a beautiful house Some of ya'll sat on the porch Looked at my windows and stared at my door They ask me if I'm going to kill it this record I laugh in their face and I ask ‘em, \"Do you see the blood on the floor?\" He's at it again, NF is crazy he's bad for the kids He never talks about nothing but him Yeah, my friends say, \"He's kind of a diva.\" Well, you need to get some new friends",

Want me to smile, you want me to laugh You want me to walk in the stage with a smile on my face When I'm mad and put on a mask, for real though I mean, what you expect from me? I'm tryna do this respectfully They say that life is a race I know my problems'll probably catch up eventually I do my best to be calm How you gon' write me and tell me you slaughter my family? That's just a glimpse to the stuff that get sent to me These the parts of my life that'll never see, woo I am aware it's aggressive I am not here for acceptance I don't know what you expect here But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session?  Therapy, therapy session  Therapy, therapy session  This girl at the show looked me in the face And told me her life's full of drama Said that her dad is abusive",

I guess that pills are more important, all you have to say is no But you won't do it will you?

Then don't get involved in it I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two faced, too fake, get outta my face, woo What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes I already passed you, you don't like what I'm doing, who asked you? You got into music cause you think it's fun, man I'm doing this cause I have to It's real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid Skills truest, quit moving, woo If I say something, I will do it I used to dream of these moments I'm living 'em now",

Heart's beating out of my chest Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands Hm, yeah, that's weird, it doesn't make sense, does it? I make songs, I don't make friends, judge me Might smile, but it ain't that funny Sing along to the pain, they love it Life's like a merry-go-round And I'm still tryna figure it out I like space, I don't fit in the crowds My whole life I've been airin' it out Oh, I'm gettin' into character now Feels wrong, but it feels right My feelings seal tight real nice But I will fight anything to win But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya' But I will tell you if I don't like you I am not the norm I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours I never been married, but I've felt divorced *Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before?* Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course You got a problem with the fans? There's the door You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh! Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together Same style, but the songs are better Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin' Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running My thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto something, yeah     I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds I kinda like it up here, I am not comin' down I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds Which is kinda confusin', I've no been that way since a child They laughin', they tell me I'll never get out I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself So I guess for now  I'll just be the outcast",

Hey, you are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list First, I dropped a record, then you know I gotta tour it Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house Hey!

You ain't the only one to blame,  no one the one that made you rich  when I bought every lie you sold to me Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures But you still got the memories of us,  so I guess I don't really make a difference Flippin' through 'em in your head Got you texting me all hours of the night Yeah, you told me that you needed distance What's the deal with you?

(Last week!) Yeah, oh, you done it now Feels like I'm coming up, but spit it like I'm underground Wonder how I come into your city like I run the town Love the sound Started on a stage, now we in the crowd, woo!

Told me that your record was the greatest, but you lied though Told me they consider you a God, yeah, well I don't Say you never lived until you found something to die for, woo! Yeah, and that is so true Forget the haters, remember people you're close to Now I'm doing things they told me I ain't supposed to They treat me like a player, that's funny, I'm here to coach you! Go back to the bench, know where you belong Say that you've been practicin', well maybe you should do it more Say that you the boss, yeah? Well, who did you employ? All these sucky rappers I don't listen to them, so annoyed!  ",

Tell me you love me, need me Promise me you'll never leave me Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street With a fist to match, more solid than concrete Tell white people I'm black, feel the need to retreat Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik But my beautiful black brothers and sisters Want to act like I'm adopted  Go back in time to when my nigga daddy Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it  My oh my (My oh my)  Oh my (My oh my)  I said oh my (Oh my)  Somebody pinch me Black man screaming, trying to convince me I'm not black So why the white man wanna lynch me?

Bitches out here be shameless And I really wonder where they parents are Look around, everything changes It feels like I've been buried alive   Everything happens for a reason People only in your life for seasons Word to Aunt Viv Death and taxes that’s all we given You can make a life but can’t make a livin' You can make it work but that still ain't driven Give a lot but that still ain't givin Livin' life like this ain’t real though Every night like this I feel so Dead wrong, collision is head on My vision is dead and gone Perception of right and wrong I been here so very long Right here in this very song Look around everything changes Seem like everybody just strangers Don’t go outside cause it’s dangerous Why everybody wanna be famous I’m so OCD if they notice me I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me Man everybody want this shit for free Hand out palm up when they get to me In my mind no I never let it get to me Everybody got a turn will it get to me V’s up motherfucka that’s victory",

Do you really wanna be a superstar? Do you really wanna get dangerous? Do you even know where the groupies are? Bitches out here be shameless And I really wonder where they parents are Look around, everything changes It feels like I've been buried alive  Everything happens for a reason People only in your life for seasons Word to Aunt Viv Death and taxes that's all we given You can make a life but can't make a livin' You can make it work but that still ain't driven Give a lot but that still ain't givin Livin' life like this ain't real though Every night like this I feel so Dead wrong, collision is head on My vision is dead and gone Perception of right and wrong I been here so very long Right here in this very song Look around everything changes Seem like everybody just strangers Don't go outside cause it's dangerous Why everybody wanna be famous I'm so OCD if they notice me",

We live in a world where everybody want everything Everybody want a better thing Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing Man, the game been waiting for a better king I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King Screaming \"Money ain't a thing\", cause it ain't Man, I never knew that living out a dream meant living out a suitcase I've been working at a new pace So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute Not a single second chilling in my new place Motherfuckers getting two-faced Cause a brother finally eating Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates You know I only got two traits Drop hits, get money Run it  What the fuck is there left to talk about I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out You never know who there for you until you fallin' out And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen Boy this been my house This is merely an addition, fuck 'em and their permission They was killin' the game, who the one that gave 'em remission? You know the name",

Tell me what makes you happy Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad Tell me what makes you happy People say its money, give me the money All the money (money)  If I could live forever and a day Know I'd never fade away But my life is not okay, I... I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed Life is fucking up my vibe, I... I wish had a lot of money Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper you already know My life would be so much better with cheddar Only work as hard as I do for vendetta Cause my 9th grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit Wouldn't be nothing Working that minimum wage and cooking McMuffins So I'm puffing on this green Wishing I had more money than I do Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, aye... And so I'm all about my business Is there anyone who witness? Can a brother get a witness like... Ah-Ooh, Ah-Ooh Wassup with it come and get it Tell me now what's on your mind I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line Somebody tell me now what done happen to society My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety They say that money cannot make you happy Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?",

Conozco el aroma que dejan tus sueños si es que puede haber. Se que piensas mucho, hablas demasiado, y resuelves poco. Se cuando estas fria y aparentas fuegos por condescender. Se que a veces mientes, y yo hago maromas por no descubrirte.  Y de que me sirve, no sirve de nada.  Si tus celos piensan que no hay aventura que se me resista. Que hasta a veces quisiera parecerme al tipo que tu crees que soy, para tener motivos, para vivir la vida, para arrancarle un tajo de locura a esta miseria,",

Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on? She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance  You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band But she fell in love with an English man Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand Said, 'Baby, I just want to dance' I just want to dance I just want to dance I just want to dance I just want to dance With my pretty little Galway Girl You're my pretty little Galway Girl Galway Girl You're my pretty little Galway Girl  You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool",

I'm not okay, but it's okay Don't walk away, I'll take the blame Before we're left with nothing.  Don't know if I'll be fine without you, I hope I'll be alright without you.  I'm tired of Fake people, fake smiles, fake hugs Fake hopes, fake friends, fake love 'Cause fake friends are a real waste of time And fake love is real waste of life.  So don't you go texting me, telling me \"Wish you were next to me.\" Rest in peace  Everything's ending eventually, Best friends can become your enemies.  Do we have to talk about it?

Verse 1: It seems the more I try to do right, The more I lie about being at sessions and leaving at certain times, She's like, \"Where you at?\" I'm at the studio at home, and I'm thinking to myself we cut that record days ago. Cause shorty on the east side, hit me and want to know if I could stop by, Now I'm contemplating what I am gonna say, bout this being the umpteenth time that Im late.  Chorus: I wanna be your superman, I'm trying to save our love the best way that I can, Cause these girls they're like kryptonite, These girls my kryptonite, These girls got kryptonite, These girls my kryptonite, And I really wanna make it work, but I cant stop messing round, I'm here doing dirt, Cause these girls they're like kryptonite, These girls my kryptonite, These girls got kryptonite, These girls my kryptonite, Oh baby.  Verse 2: It's like the more I brush them off, the more they call, The more I want to tell them that I'm not in love, With anyone, when I know it's you, Wanna tell the truth but it's just so hard to do, Caught up in me again it's driving me crazy",

(Why?) Why do you keep putting me through it, baby? You tell me you don't wanna go through it, baby You're believing all the lies that you heard about me I can't take it, no  You thinking that I'm doing you dirty, baby You better understand I'll do all I can But if I'm no good for you, then baby, I'm no good for you So tell me why are you still here?  Every night that I come home and you're laying in bed (All I wanna do is make love to you) But now I got reservations because you're acting strange",
