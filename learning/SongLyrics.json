Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)\nJust a feeling I've got.\nLike something's about to happen, but I don't know what\nIf that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble;\nand if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\nYou are just what the doc ordered\n\nI'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box\n\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot\n\nBut for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes\n\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\n\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a livin' and a killin' off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match\nWith this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'\nBackpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nAnd at the exact same time\nI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that\nI'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic\nI was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow?\nAll I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)\n\nCause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\n\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)\nMC's get taken to school with this music\nCause I use it as a vehicle to \"bus the rhyme\"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac\nN.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up\nBlow up and be in a position\nTo meet Run-D.M.C\nAnd induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******",

What's your name, man?\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton\nMy name is Alexander Hamilton\nAnd there's a million things I haven't done\nBut just you wait, just you wait...\n\nWhen he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden\nTwo years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden\nHalf-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick\n\nAnd Alex got better but his mother went quick\n\nMoved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******",

Well that's great\nI got no interest in talking to people that I know are two faced, too fake, get outta my face, woo\nWhat are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers\nI'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes\nI already passed you, you don't like what I'm doing, who asked you?\nYou got into music cause you think it's fun, man I'm doing this cause I have to\nIt's real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid\nSkills truest, quit moving, woo\nIf I say something, I will do it\nI used to dream of these moments\nI'm living 'em now\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******",

Check the source\nSomebody told you I was back? Yes, of course\nYou got a problem with the fans? There's the door\nYou lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh!\nNot a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better\nAin't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together\nSame style, but the songs are better\nBeen a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever\nAin't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'\nBig steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running\nMy thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto something, yeah\n \n\n\nI'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds\nI kinda like it up here, I am not comin' down\nI'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds\nWhich is kinda confusin', I've no been that way since a child\nThey laughin', they tell me I'll never get out\nI'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else\nI don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself\nSo I guess for now\n\nI'll just be the outcast\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******",

What are we waiting for?\nRebirth\nRebirth?... like reincarnation?\nIf that's what you wanna call it\nWhat the fuck you mean “if that's what I wanna call it?” \nEither this is what it is, or this is\n\nWhat it ain’t\nSure\nChu mean? Ughhh, this muhfucka (Atom sighs in frustration)\nAight, lemme get this straight, every time I die, I come here, we talk, and you send me back to earth to be reborn?\nou know the last time we had this conversation it was in mandarin and you were 13 Atom: Mandarin?\nAnd a girl!\nWhat? Nah, bruh, you fuckin wit me. You’re... Like, Jesus Christ\nHe was here too!\nWhat? Wait, wait, so the Christians got it right?\nWell I’m about to reincarnate you Atom. I’d say everyone kinda got it right\nThis is a whole lot to take in!\nI know trust me, I’ve been there\nSooooooo, how many times have I been reincarnated?\nMany, many many many, many times\n If it’s so many times, why don’t I remember?\nf we stayed here long enough, the lives you have lived, and the knowledge from each of them would return\nWhat?\n’m actually about to send you back to 1736 as Bryan Fairfax, the 8th lord Fairfax of Cameron\n...\n\n******* This Lyrics is NOT for Commercial use *******",
